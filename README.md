Intelligent Bus Transport System: A DigitalSolution for Maximising Public Transport in UttarPradesh

Abstract: 

Public transport in India, and specifically state roadways bus services, is plagued by problems
of non-real-time tracking of buses, inefficient route optimization, and lack of integrated digital ticketing
solutions. In this article, an Intelligent Bus Transport System (ITBS) is suggested that resolves these
problems through an integrated web and mobile-based platform. ITBS allows passengers to trace buses in
real-time, view fare and route details, and purchase tickets online—akin to the IRCTC model for trains. The system utilizes GPS-based tracking, cloud-based databases, and secure payment gateways to transform bus transportation services, with a view to enhancing operational efficiency, passenger satisfaction, and collection of revenues.
Keywords: Public Transport, Intelligent Transportation System, GPS Tracking, Digital Ticketing, Bus Management System.

1. Introduction
   
Public transport has an important part to play in urban mobility, particularly in highly populated states such as
Uttar Pradesh. The government bus systems, however, are slow in technological integration. While Indian train services have embraced digital platforms for booking and tracking, the state-run bus systems continue to use old manual practices. This creates inefficiency, inconvenience to passengers, and waste of government resources. The envisioned ITBS seeks to digitalize and streamline the current bus transport infrastructure through providing real-time tracking, fare computation, seat reservation, and route
planning features available through a common platform. efficient method.

2. Problem Statement
The existing Uttar Pradesh government bus transport system has the following issues: No real-time
tracking: The passengers cannot identify the position of buses accurately, and hence there is uncertainty
and excessive waiting times. No online booking: Tickets are commonly bought manually, which is inefficient
and time-consuming. Ineffective route management: There is no data-based optimization of bus routes
and schedules.
Revenue leakage: Manual fare collection exposes the system to higher chances of financial discrepancies.

3. Objectives To create a centralized system for bus tracking, seat booking, and fare calculation. To
offer real-time bus location updates to passengers. To include secure digital payment systems for
ticketing. To help transport authorities with data analytics for improved decision-making.

4. Proposed System
The ITBS will have
Passenger App/Web Portal: For real-time bus tracking, ticket booking, and
fare display. Driver App: Updating real-time GPS data and route assignments. Admin
Dashboard: Buses monitoring, ridership pattern analysis, and report generation. Technologies
Used: React.js/Flutter, Node.js/Flask, Firebase/PostgreSQL, Google Maps API, AWS/Firebase
Hosting, Razorpay/Paytm Payment Gateway.

5. Methodology Requirement Analysis — Requirements identification from passengers, drivers, and
government officials. System Design — Designing UML, ER diagrams, and architecture models.
Development — Frontend, backend, and database integration development. Testing — Functional,
performance, and security testing. Deployment — Hosting the web app with live GPS and payment
APIs.

6. Profit and Advantages Government: Additional revenue from online ticketing and less leakage. Passengers: Less waiting time, ease of booking, and clear fares.

7. Society: Less traffic congestion as more individuals use public transport. Environmental: Less
carbon footprint due to route optimization and more usage of public transport.

8. Conclusion
The Intelligent Bus Transportation System provides a contemporary, efficient, and scalable solution for enhancing the state-owned bus network. With digitization of operations, it facilitates greater passenger convenience, revenue to the government, and environmental friendliness. It can be a model for other Indian states to follow.
